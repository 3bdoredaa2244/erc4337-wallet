## Overview

The **ERC-4337 Wallet** is a smart contract-based wallet that implements the **ERC-4337** standard, also known as "Account Abstraction." ERC-4337 enables advanced features in Ethereum wallets, such as gasless transactions, multisig wallets, and custom authentication methods, while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum network.

This project provides a demonstration and implementation of ERC-4337, showcasing the potential of abstracting user accounts to enhance the flexibility and usability of Ethereum wallets.

### Key Features
- **Account Abstraction**: Leverages ERC-4337 to allow for more flexible wallet mechanisms.
- **Gasless Transactions**: Users can send transactions without holding ETH, relying on third parties for gas payments.
- **Custom Authentication**: Enables the creation of custom logic for user authentication and transaction verification.
- **Multisig Support**: Allows for multiple signatures to authorize a transaction.

## Background

**ERC-4337**, known as **Account Abstraction**, is an Ethereum improvement proposal designed to separate the user's wallet from the Ethereum networkâ€™s internal operations. This allows developers to implement custom wallet behaviors, such as:
- Allowing for a more seamless user experience with features like gasless transactions and automatic batching.
- Supporting multisignature wallets without needing additional infrastructure or contracts.
- Supporting custom signature schemes to enhance wallet security and user privacy.

ERC-4337 aims to make Ethereum wallets more accessible and functional for a wide variety of use cases, from decentralized applications (dApps) to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, you will need:
- **Node.js**: ^14.x or later
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry**: Ethereum development environment
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Pre-installed through npm.

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
